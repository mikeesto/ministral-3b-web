# ministral-3b-web

Run batch image analysis using the [Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512-ONNX](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512-ONNX) model in the browser.

Upload a ZIP file containing multiple images, and each image will be run against the provided prompt. Results are displayed in a tabular format with the option to download the results as a CSV file.

This project runs entirely in the browser using WebGPU. No images are sent to a server; the model download occurs once and is cached locally.

### Prerequisites

You will need a browser with **WebGPU support** enabled (e.g. recent versions of Chrome).

### Development

1.  Clone the repository and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

The first time you load the model, the application will download approximately **3GB** of model weights. Subsequent loads will use the browser cache.

Performance (tokens per second) varies based on your device's GPU capabilities.
